# My Milestone project one

### This website is to showcase skills and make my details available so potential job opportunities and clients that want me to work for them.

## UX

### This website is created for myself to show my work history and show what I have accomplished in the software development world I wanted the design to be bright and noticeable. I started off wanting 3 separate pages but after a talk with my mentor I realised a 1 page website with separate sections would be best. My website is simple easily laid out so any potential clients or employers can see what I have worked on my skills and fill in the query form to contact me.

As a potential employer I want to clearly see what the person is capable of and what their history and what they have achieved so I can decide if I want to get in contact with them.
As the owner of the website I want to be able to showcase my skills to attract would be clients and employers.

Html

CSS 

# Testing

I used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to validate my CSS and I took a screenshot of the results

I used https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea to test my html and it kept coming back one error saying 

** Warning: The main role is unnecessary for element main. ** 

 main role="main" class="flex-shrink-0" 

 But when I took out that line of code my home section text layered over each other so I have left it in.

 I had to remove som quotation marks i had left out and ending div and section tags that I had forgotten to put in
